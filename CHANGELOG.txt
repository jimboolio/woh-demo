Changelog since last excercise and the reasoning of decisions

Added "Simple CSS"
    Simple css aims to provide basic styling for semantic html.
    I personally believe that having readable web is more important
    than having a fancy looking web. Why bother with excessive styling
    if as a result you risk of breaking the built in accessibility features
    of web browsers and operating systems, which function the best with as
    vanilla html5 as possible. Styling should improve usability and
    simple css does that really well.

###############
Addition of responsive styling below
made the page responsive using css grid and flexbox, because those
are bloat free and modern bootstrap utilizes those in the background.
And if good examples are followed I feel like when understanding them
it is actually easier to manage a website rather than fighting with overrides
which are bad practise.
###############

Added responsive navbar with flexbox
    The navbar is basic but the elements wrap up to smaller screens
    as necessary.

Added footer and made it responsive with css grid
    I noticed that in the example materials the website had a footer
    and since the contents of my website article section aka. the main content
    did not really need additional responsive components I made some footer
    elements with css grid, which wraps up nicely with a simple media query
    containing styles for smaller devices.

Moved the default for simple css body grid to smaller scope div>#content
    That one is used for whole page margins, but since the footer
    was supposed to span all accross the bottom of the page, this was necessary.

Set border radius in css variable
    done to get up to 5 new css rules

Set index image to full width
    Who doesn't enjoy zoomed in naked rats?
    done to get up to 5 new css rules

Overridden simple css anchor color and anchor:visited pseudo class color
    so that the text in the link would be readable in dark background
    done to get up to 5 new css rules

Probably some others, but without git it's pretty hard to keep track
of them :).
